- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ryvy
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, mostly Unity, since that is what i already know. But I have made a vn in renpy as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development and programming, it is taking it's time, but I am sure that I will be good at it at someday
- 💞️ I would love to do a collab project in unity if anyone is interested, I mostly do programming and mechanic design.
